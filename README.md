## Project Overview

This project is the culmination of the Fullstack course delivered at the Lev Academic Center. The system is a complete client-server application that enables users to playback songs, manage playlists (general and personal), access user information, and perform various administrative tasks. The system is built using React for the client-side and Node.js with Express for the server-side. It utilizes MySQL as the database for efficient data management.

## Features

### Client-Side Features

- **User Interface**: The client-side boasts a fully functional and visually pleasing UI, providing an enjoyable user experience.
- **Components**: The React-based client-side code is organized into logical components, ensuring a maintainable and scalable architecture.
- **Routing**: The application utilizes well-defined paths on the client side for smooth navigation.

### Communication Mechanisms

- **Fetch API**: The client-side accesses the server using the Fetch API to make well-defined REST API requests.

### Server-Side Features

- **Node.js and Express**: The server-side is built using Node.js with the help of the Express library for robust development.
- **MySQL Database**: The system interacts with a MySQL database, featuring a clear and logical table architecture for efficient data management.
- **File Management**: Files are appropriately used on the server-side when required.

### User Management

- **User Types**: The system supports two types of users - clients and administrators - each with distinct permissions.
